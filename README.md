# InstaTag

An application that allows users to search for photographs using Instagram's tags.  Users can click on individual images bringing them into a lightbox modal for viewing.  Users can navigate through the images clicking the forward and back arrows or by using their keyboard arrows.

This app was created using only JavaScript.

The icons were sourced from [Font Awesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/).

This app is cross-brower compatible.  It was tested using [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) 5.0.4 in IE11 on Windows vs8.1.
